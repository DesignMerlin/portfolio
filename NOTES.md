# Notes

Running log of design and technical decisions, so future sessions have context.

## Working with Samuel

- Samuel is a product designer new to engineering. Explain what's happening in plain language and say why for every technical choice.

## 2026-10-05 — Setup

- **Moved the project out of OneDrive** to `C:\dev\portfolio`. OneDrive syncing tens of thousands of `node_modules` files causes slow installs and locked-file errors. GitHub is the backup instead.
- **pnpm 12.9.1** installed globally via npm (CLAUDE.md's package manager). Version pinned in `package.json` → `packageManager`.
- **Git** initialised on `main`. No GitHub remote yet.
- **Playwright** (`@playwright/test`, dev-only, 0 KB shipped to visitors) with Chromium + WebKit engines. WebKit = Safari/iPhone engine, since many recruiters browse on iPhone.
  - `pnpm shoot <url> [name]` → desktop (1440px, Chromium) and mobile (375px, WebKit) screenshots in `/screenshots` (gitignored).

## Open questions (from first review)

- Phase 0 content: `profile.md`, 3 case studies, Figma token link, domain.
- Hero vs. "no scroll to work" conflict. Proposal: statement + bio + work list share the first screen; Arjun's "motion proves the point" moves to the work preview or case studies. Confirmed by Antonio's mobile screenshot: no work visible in the first viewport.
- One loud moment on the Index: proposal is the work-list → case study morph; drop the stats marquee.
- NDA status of Immigify / client screens.
- Prototype View Transitions + shared-element early in Phase 1.5 (Next.js support is experimental).
